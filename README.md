![companyLogo](https://newsroom.ionis-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/etna-logo-1-noir.png)

## Informations
 1. Name of project : **TIC-DJS2**
 2. Duration : **2 weeks** (*10 nov. to 23 nov.*)

## Goal
> To prepare for the arrival of the next Pokémon game, you will need to create a new form of Pokédex for the main character. The Pokémon Company found that thousands of Pokédexes were thrown in the garbage every year because of their limited life span of one season. To overcome this problem, the Pokémon Company decided to open its database to the public via an API.

> However, due to a budget cut, the hardware side was dropped. The API is not easily accessible to Pokémon trainers, the data is difficult to retrieve.

> To overcome this problem, Nurses Joelle proposed adding Pokédex functionalities to the workstations available at the Pokémon Center.

> You are in charge of developing the new platforms. Nurses Joelle have left a set of specifications that you will find below.

## Requirements
- Debian **10**

# Utilisation

## Lauch with Docker
```bash
docker pull containers.ikf3.com/etna/tic-djs2
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
