## Informations
 1. Name of project : **TIC-DJS2**
 2. Duration : **2 weeks** (*10 nov. to 23 nov.*)

## Goal
> To prepare for the arrival of the next Pokémon game, you will need to create a new form of Pokédex for the main character. The Pokémon Company found that thousands of Pokédexes were thrown in the garbage every year because of their limited life span of one season. To overcome this problem, the Pokémon Company decided to open its database to the public via an API.

> However, due to a budget cut, the hardware side was dropped. The API is not easily accessible to Pokémon trainers, the data is difficult to retrieve.

> To overcome this problem, Nurses Joelle proposed adding Pokédex functionalities to the workstations available at the Pokémon Center.

> You are in charge of developing the new platforms. Nurses Joelle have left a set of specifications that you will find below.
